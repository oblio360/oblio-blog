This article is a part of the *HearthCraft* series of articles, where I discuss about the cards that should be crafted
first in Hearthstone, when playing on a budget. And we're all playing on a budget.

So, let's get to business and discuss about the key rare neutral cards, cards you should craft first when you're
thinking about crafting rare neutral cards.

<img src="/images/common/knife-juggler.png" alt="Knife Juggler" style="float: right">

#### Knife Juggler

Knife Juggler, partner in aggro crime with Leper Gnome and Abusive Sergeant. If your deck is a aggro deck, there's a
huge chance that Knife Juggler is in it. Knife Juggler is so good that he's even played in midrange decks that have some
method of spamming minions.

Knife Juggler is a 2 mana minion with a 3/2 body and a very powerful effect: it does 1 damage to a random enemy when a
friendly minion is summoned. This makes it very powerful since Knife Juggler can trade 2 for 1, 3 for 1 and maybe even
higher with the right amount of luck.

It's easily one of the most threatening low-cost minions in the game (should be killed on sight).

<img src="/images/common/azure-drake.png" alt="Azure Drake" style="float: right">

#### Azure Drake

Azure Drake costs 5 mana and comes with a 4/4 body. Nothing to write home about. But it also draws a card, provides +1
spell damage and is a dragon. All of which are powerful extras.

Almost every midrange deck runs it as well as most spell-based combo decks. The Drake is a "fast" card since it draws
another card as soon as it is played and it also helps buff cheaper spells providing them the extra damage needed to
destroy tougher targets.

The 4/4 is also decent as it can trade 1 for 1 with many cards and is in a sweet spot regarding stats, since most cheap
removal can't kill it.

<img src="/images/common/defender-of-argus.png" alt="Defender of Argus" style="float: right">

#### Defender of Argus

One of the "weakest" minions in the rare category, Defender of Argus doesn't seem like a "must have" minion. However his
2/3 body comes with a powerful battlecry, since it grants both taunt and 1/1 to the minions next to the defender.

As a result Defender of Argus actually provides a total 4 damage, 5 HP and 2 taunts for 4 mana, if there are 2 targets on the
board. 2 damage also have "charge", since they can be used immediately "as part" of the minions already present on the
board.

Defender of Argus is a popular defensive option for classes which lack powerful class taunt minions. However, it is
versatile and can be seen even in aggressive decks which spam the board since the extra HP provided to the minions on
its left and right can take them out of AOE range or make trades very awkward for the enemy.
