[League of Explorers (LoE)]({% post_url 2015-11-13-league-of-explorers-reviews %}) has brought with it several deck
types enabled by newly added cards.

{% include inline-image.html alt="Unearthed Raptor" %}

<div class="article-description">
Sometimes a new card can create a new deck type for a class. One of the League of Explorers cards, Unearthed Raptor, has
done just that. Unearthed Raptor is a 3 mana 3/4 minion with a very powerful battlecry effect: it can copy the deathrattle of
any friendly minion, thus having its own deathrattle.
This has enabled Rogue, which was traditionally a spell-based class, to focus on a more minion-heavy play style. Some
people have even gone so far as to call it "Zoo". The new, minion-based deck is commonly known as "Raptor Rogue" or
"Deathrattle Rogue".

<br>
<br>

The general idea is simple: since Unearthed Raptor is a midgame minion which can copy powerful deathrattles, just create
a deck which includes the most powerful deathrattles.

Deathrattles from <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/513-leper-gnome">Leper Gnome</a> to <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12187-sneeds-old-shredder">Sneed's Old Shredder</a> have been tested in Raptor
Rogue decks, with varying degrees of success at all levels of play.

Here I'll present my own variation of Raptor Rogue, with a card-by-card explanation for things I've included and thing's
I've excluded that might be alternatives to my choices, as well as a mulligan guide and a general game play guide.

I've managed to reach legend with this variation and I think that the deck is competitive for most levels of play and
it's definitely a lot of fun to play!

## Deck list

Cards included:

* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/471-backstab">Backstab</a> - very cheap and efficient removal, hard to take
  out of any Rogue deck; used to clear smaller minion or to add some chip damage when killing a bigger minion.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/92-cold-blood">Cold Blood</a> - Nerubian Egg activator, allows trading up
  minions, racing aggro decks and giving extra reach for lethal.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/577-abusive-sergeant">Abusive Sergeant</a> - Nerubian Egg activator, allows
  trading up minions, racing aggro decks and giving extra reach for
  lethal (the minion form of Cold Blood :smile:).
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/382-eviscerate">Eviscerate</a> - Backstab's bigger brother that can also
  hit face; used to clear very threatening small minions or bigger minions or as burst damage when going for lethal.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7756-haunted-creeper">Haunted Creeper</a> - deathrattle, sticky minion that
  can fight off aggro minions and also provides several bodies which can be used (& abused) by Cold blood, Abusive
  Sergeant or Defender of Argus.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/395-loot-hoarder">Loot Hoarder</a> - deathrattle, cheap and efficient
  minion that also draws a card; used early game to fend off aggro and late game to draw more cards together with Raptor
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7738-nerubian-egg">Nerubian Egg</a> - deathrattle of great value,
  especially when comboed with Raptor; used to build up a board which is very resilient to board clears.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/378-fan-of-knives">Fan of Knives</a> - good AOE against aggro also provides
  more card draw
* 1x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/73-big-game-hunter">Big Game Hunter</a> - cleanest solution to Dr. Boom,
  also used against Mysterious Challenger (when buffed) or against Giants; overall, most efficient solution to big
  minions.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/27220-unearthed-raptor">Unearthed Raptor</a> - the card that started it
  all; solid 3 mana 3/4 minion that is extremely versatile and can provide a sticky board, more card draw or even
  special deathrattle effects (Sylvanas, Boom Bot) when needed.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/542-defender-of-argus">Defender of Argus</a> - egg activator, anti-aggro
  card, allows trading up minions, racing aggro decks and giving extra reach for lethal; all round, great card in this
  deck.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12191-piloted-shredder">Piloted Shredder</a> - deathrattle and [all-round
  best 4 mana minion in the game]({% post_url 2015-11-19-hearthcraft-key-commons %}).
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/280-azure-drake">Azure Drake</a> - card draw, +1 spell damage for more
  efficient minion removal or better reach for lethal and on top of that a decent minion body.
* 1x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/14434-dark-iron-skulker">Dark Iron Skulker</a> - another, slightly more
  powerful AOE that also leaves a 4/3 minion behind.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7749-sludge-belcher">Sludge Belcher</a> - deathrattle, double taunt to
  block aggro.
* 1x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/33-sylvanas-windrunner">Sylvanas Windrunner</a> - another deathrattle and a
  decent 5/5 body; great in control match ups especially against classes where you want to block a big drop; copying the
  deathrattle with the Raptor can be strong as it can potentially block 2 powerful turns from your opponent.
* 1x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12182-dr-boom">Dr. Boom</a> - more deathrattles on top of probably the [best
  7 mana minion in the game]({% post_url 2015-11-19-hearthcraft-key-commons %}).

## Tech cards and alternatives

* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12175-piloted-sky-golem">Piloted Sky Golem</a> - great body, great
  deathrattle, it's probably the best card that was no included in the deck; I favored Sylvanas as Sylvanas is stronger
  against control decks.
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/27215-sir-finley-mrrgglton">Sir Finley Mrrgglton</a> - the Rogue hero power is
  not that useful in this zooish deck after early game so swapping it for a better one is strong.
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/27214-brann-bronzebeard">Brann Bronzebeard</a> - there are a lot of
  battlecries in this deck so Brann is a strong contender; it can either beef up your Argus taunt or give you more reach
  for lethal.
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/498-cairne-bloodhoof">Cairne Bloodhoof</a> - useful against more grindy,
  control oriented decks.
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/525-bloodmage-thalnos">Bloodmage Thalnos</a> - fills almost the same role as
  Loot Hoarder but provides extra spell power for your nukes; situationally better than Loot Hoarder.
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/74-acidic-swamp-ooze">Acidic Swamp Ooze</a> - the dreaded weapon killer, this
  time used by a Rogue that doesn't rely on weapons :smile:; useful for metas where weapons are extremely abundant.
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12227-antique-healbot">Antique Healbot</a> - great in a meta with a lot of
  aggression through spells or hero powers (Hunter, mostly); generally great for leveling as most of the sub-level 10
  decks are very aggressive.
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/385-sap">Sap</a> - Sap can be a great choice for a more-tempo oriented
  play-style.
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12187-sneeds-old-shredder">Sneed's Old Shredder</a> - big deathrattle, great
  in a grindy meta; can be used instead of a Sludge Belcher.

## Cards which have been intentionally excluded

* All Rogue weapon buffs and <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/244-blade-flurry">Blade Flurry</a> - you live and
  die by your minions, not spells; weapon buffs will slow down this game plan while Blade Flurry without them is useless
  since using it on a naked dagger is too weak.
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/513-leper-gnome">Leper Gnome</a> - doesn't trade well with anything and this
  is not a pure aggro deck; think of this deck more like Midrange Zoo than Aggro Zoo.
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/386-harvest-golem">Harvest Golem</a> - the main body doesn't trade up while
  the deathrattle doesn't make up for this weakness.
* <a href=http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7740-baron-rivendare">Baron Rivendare</a> - Baron Rivendare isn't threatening
  enough when played on its own and the extra proccing of deathrattles doesn't help much as this deck can already fill
  the board reliably.

## Game plan

The general game plan is similar to that of Zoo: get control of the board early and don't let it go. If you do lose it,
unlike Zoo, there are some comeback mechanisms in Fan of Knives and Dark Iron Skulker, but they're not powerful enough
to turn a game around on their own if the board has been lost completely.

Against aggro decks and almost every kind of deck except for super late game control, you're the control deck. There's
no healing in the deck so once you get too low you're probably dead. However, with your very cheap and efficient
removal, small and sticky minions and your hero power, winning the board around round 4 should be achievable in most
games.

The perfect game start would be:

* Turn 1: Coin / Nerubian Egg
* Turn 2: Haunted Creeper or Backstab + hero power to kill the opposing minion
* Turn 3: Raptor on the Nerubian Egg
* Turn 4: Piloted Shredder
* Turns 5 & later: solidify the board, preferably by keeping deathrattles so that enemy AOE cannot wipe your board

Mid game things become a bit fuzzy since you need to balance out doing face damage to controlling the board. The reason
for this is that the deck is fundamentally a midgame oriented deck, not a super late game control deck that wants to
drag out the game to fatigue.

As a simple rule, favor doing face damage to Control Warriors, Priests, Paladins and Handlocks after turn 7 or so, since
it's unlikely you'll be able to control the board forever with a board that is actually threatening (this deck can flood
the board with many bodies but sometimes they're just 0/2s, 1/2s, 1/3s which are not really threatening to a control
class.

<img alt="Favorable Match Ups" src="/images/posts/how-to-raptor-rogue/favorable.jpg" style="float: right;">

#### Favorable match ups

##### Secret Paladin

Mulligan for: Backstab, Egg, Creeper, Raptor, Fan of Knives (only if you already have a 2-drop in your hand; Fan is used
to counter Muster for Battle).

Stick things on the board, clear everything the opponent plays until turn 6 (Mysterious Challenger turn), then depending
on the turn of the game, either grind down the Paladin with an endless supply of deathrattles or rush face if you have a
lot of burst in your hand (Secret Paladins don't really have defense).

##### Aggro Druid

Mulligan for: Backstab, Egg, Creeper, Raptor, Eviscerate or BGH (only if you already have a 2-drop in your hand;
Eviscerate is used to counter an early Druid of the Claw or Fel Reaver).

Same general plan as for Secret Paladin until turn 5 (Fel Reaver turn) with an emphasis for taunting up after turn 9.
The main ways you lose are to an uncontested Fel Reaver (face tanking it isn't a good choice) or a lucky Force of Nature
/ Savage Roar combo early on.

##### Midrange Hunter

Mulligan for: Backstab, Egg, Creeper, Raptor.

Same general plan as for Secret Paladin until turn 7 (Dr. Boom turn) with an emphasis on racing after this turn as the
Hunter hero power will whittle you down.

##### Hybrid Hunter

Mulligan for: Backstab, Egg, Creeper, Raptor.

This game is a race after turn 3. Clear all the beasts after turn 5 if it's not too costly, to avoid huge spikes
of damage from Kill command.

##### Control Warrior

Mulligan for: Egg, Creeper, Raptor, Eviscerate (to cleanly clear Armorsmith or Acolyte of Pain).

Stick things on the board and grind down every threat with efficient removal. Don't overtextend into Brawl. If the
Warrior is running two copies of Brawl, the match up becomes way harder.

##### Handlock

Mulligan for: Egg, Creeper, Raptor, BGH.

Same rule of making a sticky board. Ignore most minions played if not giants but don't bring the Warlock too low before
you're ready for the burst.

<img alt="Unavorable Match Ups" src="/images/posts/how-to-raptor-rogue/unfavorable.jpg" style="float: right;">

### Unfavorable match ups

##### Priest

Most minions are bigger than yours, Priest hero power makes them sticky. This deck doesn't have enough 1-turn burst to
kill them from higher life totals (you're not Miracle Rogue). Also Cabal Shadow Priest can steal most of of your minions
causing a huge game swing.

##### Renolock

Several strong AOEs, many strong Warlock minions, better late game than yours, no way to grind them down efficiently and
insufficient burst. Maybe Sneed's could help, but I don't have him :smile:


##### Face Hunter

Pure Face Hunter is a dice roll. On your part it relies on having sticky minions and Defender of Argus in the mulligan.

But overall, you're disadvantaged since Face Hunter has a ton of damage and this deck is neither fast enough to race
nor defensive enough to stall out the game long enough for the Hunter to run out of steam.

##### Aggro Shaman

Similar situation to the Face Hunter match up. On top of it, Aggro Shaman has higher burst. If you're facing a lot of
Aggro Shaman teching in Acidic Swamp Ooze is a decent choice.

## Variations of the deck.
