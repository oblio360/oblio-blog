<div class="article-description">
    This article is a part of the <i>Hearthcraft</i> series of article, where I present the best cards to craft if you
    want to have a rich card collection that will allow you to create as many powerful decks with a minimal investment
    of <a href="http://hearthstone.oblio360.com/2015/09/15/cash-time-gold-dust/">cash or
    time</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    I'll be presenting the cards which I think are the most efficient Druid cards. When I say "efficient" I mean that
    these cards have a great ratio of <b>power level</b> (how strong the cards actually are) coupled <b>flexibility</b>
    (if they can be used in multiple decks and deck types) to <b>cost</b> (how much $$$ or time or gold/arcane dust you
    have to spend on them).
    <br>
    <br>
    Druid cards have a very clear theme: flexibility. Most of the Druid cards can be used in one of two ways. Each
    option individually is not very strong but once they are coupled in the same card they become quite strong.

If you're looking for neutral cards (for example you might be wondering why <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12182-dr-boom">Dr. Boom</a> isn't here), then you should head over here:

Now that you've finished the articles about the neutral cards and are wondering which Druid cards you should craft
first, read on :wink:

### <a name="druid">Druid</a>

<img alt="Keeper of the Grove" src="/images/common/keeper-of-the-grove.png" style="float: right;">

#### Keeper of the Grove

Good, old, trustworthy Keeper of the Grove. As a new player the 4 mana 2/4 minion doesn't seem much (the standard for a
4 mana minion is 4/5). But the effect makes up for the fact that the stats on the actual minion are low.

Keeper of the Grove can either do 2 damage to an enemy or silence an enemy. This provides any deck which includes it a
lot of flexibility as the Keeper can take out a small threat, such as a <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/422-knife-juggler">Knife Juggler</a>, finish off a damaged larger enemy or silence
a minion with a very dangerous effect (such as <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/33-sylvanas-windrunner">Sylvanas
Windrunner</a>). In case of emergencies it can even do 2 face damage to finish off an enemy.

The effect provided by him is very powerful and the body, even though understatted, is still good. It especially good at
fighting off small minions, such as those in aggro decks. Keeper of the Grove can even 3 for 1 aggro minions (1 with its
effect, 2 with its body).

One of the most reliable Druid cards, seen in aggro, midrange and control Druid decks.

<img alt="Darnassus Aspirant" src="/images/common/darnassus-aspirant.png" style="float: right;">

#### Darnassus Aspirant

One of the latest entries (it was introduced in [The Grant
Tournament](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/The_Grand_Tournament)), Darnassus Aspirant is a 2 mana 2/3 minion which
comes with 2 effects: its battlecry increases your total mana by 1 and its deathrattle decreases it by 1.

If not killed on time Darnassus Aspirant allows the Druid to play cards which cost more mana ahead of time (this is
called "ramping"). Very dangerous, since the Druid has access to very powerful big cards such as <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/605-cenarius">Cenarius</a> or to a very strong and famous combo: <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/237-force-of-nature">Force of Nature</a> / <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/329-savage-roar">Savage Roar</a>.

Also, in a similar way to the Keeper of the Grove, its body is also a defensive one: 2/3 instead of 3/2. This means that
the Aspirant can also trade favorably with smaller minions. The 3 health also makes it harder to kill under some
circumstances, therefore allowing it to survive longer so that the player can take advantage of its battlecry.

The Aspirant is also seen in many types of decks ranging from aggro to control.

<img alt="Druid of the Claw" src="/images/common/druid-of-the-claw.png" style="float: right;">

#### Druid of the Claw

Another staple of Druid decks, Druid of the Claw is the best known "transformer" in the game. When played for 5 mana,
Druid of the Claw can either become a Bear (4/6 with Taunt) or a Cat (/4/4 with Charge).

Both forms are strong, although there is a slight preference for the Bear. The Cat form is usually chosen when an enemy
minion really needs to be destroyed this turn and there's no alternative way to do it or the enemy can be killed this
round.

Druid of the Claw is so solid and versatile that he can be seen in all types of Druid decks. The Cat is greatly
appreciated in aggro decks while the Bear is welcome in midrange or control Druid decks.

<img alt="Force of Nature" src="/images/common/force-of-nature.png" style="float: right;">

### Force of Nature

One of the best known spells in the game. Not on its own. But as part of the most famous Hearthstone combo: Force of
Nature / <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/329-savage-roar">Savage Roar</a>. On its own Force of Nature is not
something to write home about, for 6 mana it provides just 6 damage. <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/522-fireball">Fireball</a> provides the same amount of damage for 6 mana. Force of
Nature shines because it is a versatile spell (the core characteristic of all Druid cards). It can do 6 damage to the
enemy's face or to his minions. Since it spawns 3 minions with charge, each of them can be used independently to focus
another target, for example for clearing the opponent's board.

But its highlight is when it is paired with Savage Roar. For 9 mana this combo does a total of 14 damage (2 from the
hero itself and 4 from each treant). As a result every Druid opponent has to make sure that he has a taunt up when his
life total is below 15 HP.

<img alt="Wrath" src="/images/common/wrath.png" style="float: right;">

#### Wrath

Wrath is a 2 mana cost spell that is used for removing a small but very threatening minion, finishing off a larger
minion or drawing a card (when it only does 1 damage).

This flexibility comes at a cost as Wrath can only target minions, but the flexibility greatly surpasses this downside
and as a result Wrath is seen in almost all Druid decks.

It is frequently used to fend off very aggressive decks or to draw 1 more card when the Druid player is out of fuel
(usually when he is the one playing the beatdown deck).

Used in all but the most aggressive of Druid decks.

<img alt="Ancient of Lore" src="/images/common/ancient-of-lore.png" style="float: right;">

#### Ancient of Lore

The venerable tre(e)ant is another example of a very versatile card. For 7 mana you get a 5/5 body that can either heal
you for 5 or draw 2 cards.

The 5/5 body is a little under the standard for a 5 mana minion while its effect costs either a little under 2 mana (<a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/108-holy-light">Holy Light</a>) or a little under 3 mana (<a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/489-arcane-intellect">Arcane Intellect</a>). The whole package definitely deserves
paying 7 mana for.

In general the effect is used to draw cards, especially when "fishing" for the parts of the Force of Nature / Savage
Roar combo. But against aggro decks it can also be used to heal yourself and gain a bit more time to stabilize on board
and eventually win the game.

Ancient of Lore is seen in all but the most aggressive of Druid decks and is one of the core cards of the decks he's
part of.

<img alt="Living Roots" src="/images/common/living-roots.png" style="float: right;">

#### Living Roots

Living Roots is another new entry in the Druid arsenal. It was introduced in TGT, together with Darnassus Aspirant, and
it was widely adopted by the community.

Its uses are multiple: fend off aggressive decks through the Saplings or the nuke, damage the enemy's face (probably
just before winning the game), provide more "boots on the ground" to be used next round for Savage Roar.

Some of the fastest wins in the game have involved Living Roots (2x Living Roots provide 4 minions, and when Savage Roar
is used these 4 minions total 12 damage, 2x Savage Roar and the damage goes up to 20 damage; add the 2 / 4 damage that
the hero gets from Savage Roar and a quick win is possible).
