<div class="article-description">

<a href="http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Curse_of_Naxxramas">Curse of Naxxramas</a> is Hearthstone's first adventure, released in
July 2014. Adventures are Hearthstone "mini-expansions" in which the player has to defeat Hearthstone "bosses" (heroes
with special hero abilities and custom decks which can contain unique cards). For each boss defeated the player receives
a reward: a card or a pair of cards.  These cards cannot be obtained through crafting, the only way to obtain them is to
buy the adventure (with cash or gold) and to beat the boss.
<br>
<br>
Each adventure has a normal mode and a heroic mode. The normal mode is the one that offers the cards as rewards while
the heroic mode is much more difficult and has as a reward a special card back. The card back is available once all the
heroic mode bosses have been defeated.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSmjrqVod1_sXqFl9AS4fRg">TommyJ</a> has managed to beat all the bosses from the current
adventures using only basic cards: cards you start out with and cards you get while leveling up heroes. He has made
guides for defeating the heroic bosses using decks he created.
<br>
<br>
With his blessing I'm republishing his guides as I think they're a great resource for newer players, especially since
the same decks can be used for finishing normal mode (heroic mode is much harder than the normal mode). This article
contains his first guide, for beating the Arachnid Quarter from the Curse of Naxxramas.

> So I set out yesterday with the goal of beating all 3 bosses of the Arachnid Quarter in heroic using only basic cards
> and managed to actually get it. When I say basic cards, I mean only cards that you can get before opening a pack (not
> including the cards that you can get by beating the quarter on normal - I didn't use any of them).

> For Anub'Rekhan, I used a Shaman deck, for Grand Widow Faerlina I used a Warlock deck and for Maexxna I used a Warrior
> deck.

> Heroic Maexxna was by far the most challenging; I tried it with several decks (Priest, Warlock, Druid and Shaman) with
> various different combos before attempting it with the Warrior. I actually managed to 1 shot Anub and 2 Shot Faerlina
> (first attempt was with the Shaman deck from Anub but couldn't ditch my cards fast enough so got completely stomped by
> her hero ability). It's definitely worth mentioning that I didn't life tap against Faerlina; I went with the Warlock
> because they have cards that will discard others when used such as the Succubus so her hero power was pretty useless.

Stay tuned for part 2!
