title: "The vanishing history of Dota"
tags: [ history, opinion ]

When I started thinking about this blog I wanted to tell the story of Dota and Dota 2, from their earliest days in 2003.
I started gathering information, carefully bookmarking things I found on the Internet.

As I advance with this project I've come to a sad realization: Dota history is vanishing.

The earliest days of Dota haven't been recorded anywhere, it's just oral history. To properly write the history of Dota
interviews with people who have been there from the start will be required. So I will try to have those interviews with
Dota's creators and key personalities from the early days. But this will take time, and by then they might forget important
details. So there's a good chance we will lose forever some of the most important moments in this history.

Of course, not everything will be lost, there are already articles and interviews on the internet. But the internet is a
harsh mistress: many of those community maintaned sites are no longer running. Many of them were PHPBB forums which are
now vanishing from the internet. Even larger ones are threatened.

The original Dota site, dota-allstars.com, belonged to Pendragon, which was a sort of "community manager" for Dota. He's
since moved on to co-found Riot (aka League of Legends) and he caused a lot of bad blood when one day he just shut down
the site & forum and put up a billboard advertising LoL on the site.

Luckily for us Icefrog had already drawn a large part of the community over to playdota.com. But some brilliant pieces
of Dota history were lost forever. Yes, I know that years later, after he almost killed the community, Pendragon
released the forum database and [da-archive.com](http://da-archive.com/) appeared but it's mostly broken, unfortunately
:weary:

Anyway, I want to bring back the atmosphere of those early years of Dota and I hope you accompany me on this journey!
:smile:

And just for fun, here's a brilliant article written by [FoxNetworks a long, long time ago on the dota-allstars.com site
(maybe in 2007?)](http://www.playdota.com/forums/showthread.php?t=517562). I painstakingly recreated it on playdota.com
with the help of the [Internet Archive (aka the Wayback Machine)](https://archive.org/index.php), a brilliant effort to
save old sites. If you can, [donate to help the Internet Archive as they're an awesome
non-profit](https://archive.org/donate/).

Enjoy FoxNetworks' article and if you have personal stories or resources about Dota's history, please comment below.
