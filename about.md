Hello there! :smile:

My name is Oblio and I will be your host on blog.oblio360.com.

I am a geek, interested primarily in computers and computer games, but also in history and science in general.

This is the place where I'll write about things that interest me personally and don't fit into the neat niches I've
setup on the other sites :smile:

Enjoy your visit and if you'd like you can contact me by:

* [Facebook](https://facebook.com/oblio360)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oblio360)
* or just plain ol' comments :wink:
